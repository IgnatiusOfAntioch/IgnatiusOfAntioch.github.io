"Greetings, friends around the world!"

Sorry -- I mean, *Hello*.

My name is Darren. “COG” is short for the “Church of God” movement — a declining quasi-Christian tradition not yet 100 years old. It was spawned by Herbert W. Armstrong, whose ministry began around 1934. He is the founder of the Worldwide Church of God (WCG).

I was born into the WCG, and at age 19 — during the early stages of “the changes” in WCG doctrine — I joined the Church of God International (CGI), founded by Armstrong’s son, Garner Ted Armstrong.

Now I’m a Tradition-minded Catholic. My conversion story is published [here](https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/my-path-to-the-worldwide-church-that-jesus-built) at the Catholic Answers website.

I don’t resent my upbringing in Armstrongism (as it is more aptly called). It was while I was still a COG member that I desired to find and follow “the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints” (Jude 3). My background, as off course as it was, led me to Catholicism's on-ramp. It's part of my story, and I'm glad it is.

Yet, at the same time, I wish I had known someone in my earlier young adult years who could both
1. understand COG doctrines and its culture, *and*
2. offer reasonable and charitable critiques of it while explaining Catholicism in terms I could understand.

**This blog is NOT intended *only* for those who share my background,** but I do write in a way that might have helped my understanding if I could send it to my 1992 self, when I was a young, devout COGer facing the world ahead of me.
