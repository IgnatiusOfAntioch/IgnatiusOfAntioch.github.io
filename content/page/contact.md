# Send an Email

[Email me](mailto:thecogcatholic@outlook.com) at **TheCOGCatholic** (an Outlook.com address).

---

*Here is my [GPG key](https://brax.me/f/thecogcatholic-publickey.asc/T4AZ65f39b24a4d9f0.03006025) IF you wish to encrypt your email.*

*To encrypt emails using...*

|  |  |
| --- | ----------- |
| Thunderbird: | See video "[Encrypt your Personal Email with Thunderbird](https://youtu.be/MvQYVhj4f9c)." |
| Webmail | Use [Mailvelope](https://mailvelope.com/en) with its browser extension.
| Android | Use [K-9 Mail](https://k9mail.app/) from Google Play or F-Droid.
| (Alternative) | Just use the "Online PGP tool" at [aliceandbob.io](https://aliceandbob.io/online-pgp-tool). (Paste the text of [my public PGP/GPG key](https://brax.me/f/thecogcatholic-publickey.asc/T4AZ65f39b24a4d9f0.03006025) into the right side of the screen. Type your message on the left side. Then copy and paste the resulting encrypted message straight into your email.) | |
| Protonmail | You should probably be using this anyway for your personal emails if you don't want to learn how to do your own email encryption. If you email from a Proton account, it should encrypt your email to me automatically. If not, it will after I reply to your initial email (all my emails to Proton email accounts are automatically encrypted -- sweet deal). Get your free account at https://proton.me/mail.

# Direct Message Me

- **XMPP** (a.k.a. Jabber):
	- **darren@chatterboxtown.us**
	- *(Despite its appearance, this is not an email address.)*
	- This is my favorite messaging protocol. It's light as a feather, and lightning fast.
	- Get set up with XMPP [here](https://xmpp.org/getting-started/).

---

- **Signal**:
	- Send message to username **Darren.73**
	- I regularly use Signal.
	- Download Signal from [here](www.signal.org).

---

- **Session Messenger**

	- My Session ID is **Darren**.
	- I paid $5 to get this alias for my Session ID so I wouldn't have to provide you with the super-long string of alpha-numeric characters.
	- I regularly use Session.
	- (If it's too much work to type **Darren**, scan QR code below with the Session app, which you can get [here](https://getsession.org).)
	
---

- **Matrix**

	- Send me a message at **@heavyd:monero.social**.
	- I don't use Matrix often, but I'll see your message.
